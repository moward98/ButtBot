# ButtBot - An Autonomous Cigarette Collection Robot

Hello, and welcome!

The award winning ButtBot was created as a Fourth Year Design Project by 5 Electrical Engineering students at the University of Waterloo. This GitHub repo was created as a way 
to condense some of the information / media about ButtBot, making it easier to share this incredible project with others.

For information regarding what it is, why it exists, and who created it, please see the [ButtBot Infographic](https://github.com/moward98/ButtBot/blob/main/ButtBot%20Infographic.gif).
